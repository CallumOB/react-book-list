# Learning React 18

This repository was setup for me to use while learning React.
I am using the tutorial ['Learn React 18 with Redux Toolkit' by John Smilga](https://youtu.be/2-crBg6wpp0?si=bgDoL73MzKLjMSan), available from [freecodecamp.org.](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

The subdirectories of this repository contain different React apps I have built as part of the course.
